# md-setup-gist-cross-solvation
Starting structures and parameter files for the paper "Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory for Cross-Solvation in Rigid Solvents"

Molecule naming is as follows:
| Abbreviation | Molecule  |
| ------------ | --------- |
| ALN | Aniline |
| BZN | Benzene |
| CL3 | Chloroform |
| CX4 | Tetrachloromethane |
| DMD | Dimethylacetamide |
| MTL | Methanol |
| PPN | Acetone (Propanone) |
| PRN | Pyridine |
| TOL | Toluene |
| WAT | Water |

The parameter files for water are missing because TIP3P was used. The parameter files for CL3 are taken from AmberTools. All other parameter files were generated using antechamber, and charges were produced using a RESP fit based on HF/6-31G* calculations performed in Gaussian 16.
